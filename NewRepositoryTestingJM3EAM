This is just a sample random test to ensure I am getting familiar with how to create repos.
I have a long way to go getting familiar with Github.
I think I have done this task correctly. However, still confused on how to navigate around it.
My end goal is to be more fluid in coding - trully I believe that programming language is better suited for a full semester and not a summer term.
Good luck to everyone.
